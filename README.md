# EclipseSharp
EclipseSharp (Eclipse#) is a small project determined to replace the old Visual Basic 6 engine commonly used to create small ORPGs with. While the project is not designed to be a fully featured engine ready to create any game, the initial aim is to at the very least offer the base functionality of Eclipse Origins 2.0, which at the time offered a great base to create a very simple game with.

The engine will be written in C# and use SFML for its graphical aspects. The networking will be provided by a small homebrew class that runs on .Net sockets.

## Current Goals
At the present time the main goal is to get a fully operational ''game'' running where players can register, log in and walk around a basic world alongside of other players.

This goal includes a map editor and a small chat box.
